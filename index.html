Welcome to the game.

To reach your prize, you’ll have to prove yourself first.
There will be riddles, clues, and maybe a few traps (depending on how smart you are 😏)
But before the *real* adventure begins, you need to show me that you *deserve* to play.

So here’s your first little enigma.
Solve it… and the hunt begins. 💋`

        type: "text",
        text: `Nicely done… you’ve cracked the enigma. 💖
But let’s see if your memory is as sharp as your brain.
Tell me — what happened on that day?
(Type it in a few words — be honest, be detailed… or flirty if you remember 😏)`

Well done, Andrew. Your prize (and the hunt) awaits.`

Welcome to the *actual* game.

Here’s the deal: to complete this scavenger hunt, you’ll need to find a few places around Denver. Don’t worry — they’re not too far apart, I’m not that crazy 😏

To solve each puzzle, you’ll need to decode riddles and get to the right location. Once you’re there, you have to take a picture as proof. You **cannot** move on until you’ve figured out the previous location *and* sent me the photo.

You *can* ask for clues or hints — call or text me if you need to — but I can only answer **yes or no**, so think carefully before you ask.

Ready… let’s see if you can handle it. 💋`

The story started here,
Do you recall where?
Clocks were ticking, feet in race,
But time stood still in that place.`,

    },
    {
        type: "message",
        text: `Congratulations, Andrew… looks like you’ve made it to the first location! 🎉

But don’t get too comfortable — I won’t make it *that* easy for you.
Before you can move on to the next spot, you’ll need to solve the next riddle. 
Are you ready? 😉`

One often left the other in fear. 😉

And your next clue comes into sight.`,
